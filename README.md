# World_Weather_Analysis
Bootcamp Week 6
## Background
The purposes of this project was to create an app that would help vacationers located hotels within a desired temperature range, then plan an itenerary to visit 4 cities within one country. 

## Results
I was able to successfully generate a heat map of hotels available within the preferred maximum temperature of 75 - 90 degrees F as showing in the figure below:

Looking at the locations highlighted, French Guiana would be an idea country to visit with 4 locations to plan a road trip

In the coding exercise, I was able to assign latitude and logitude values to each itenerary stop, but I struggled to create tuples of the locations to use within the directions API
